This applicatiion is a backend setup that can be used by online retailers to keep track of their products.  With the application, a user can add, delete, and update their product list and inventory. 

## Motivation
My motivation for this application was to create an easy way for retailers to keep up with their products and inventory.  This back-end application supplies retailers with an easy way to view, update, add, or delete products from their inventory.
